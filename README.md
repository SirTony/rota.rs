# Rota

A job scheduler library for Rust built on top of tokio. This project is partially inspired by tokio itself, env_logger, and other job scheduling libraries.

#### Disclaimer

This library exists primarily for the author's own benefit, both as a means of delving deeper into learning the Rust language and supporting the needs of such a library for a personal project.

This library does not claim to be in any way production-ready, nor is becoming a production-ready, enterprise-grade, and performant project on the roadmap; it is simply presented as-is.

This library should be considered a prototype currently, and the public API can and will change without warning. Use at your own risk.
